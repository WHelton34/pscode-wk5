c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input i1, i2, i3,i4,i5
avg=(i1+i2+i3+i4+i5)/5
Small=i1
large=i1
for n=2 to 5:
if i1> in then
small=in
if i<in then: 
large+in
print("average:", avg)
print("smallest:", small)
print("largest:" large)
